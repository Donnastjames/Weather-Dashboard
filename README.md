# Weather-Dashboard

This is a weather application that allows the user to search for weather conditions for a specific city by typing in a city name.  The current weather is displayed as well as the 5-day Forecast when the 'Search' button is clicked.  The data returned include temperature, windspeed, humidity, as well as the UV Index for the current day.  A corresponding icon is shown depending on the weather conditions.  The UV Index range also shows the corresponding color depending on the condition - low, moderate, high, very high or extreme. I used the UV Index range found in the EPA website to get the numbers as well as the corresponding colors for each range.

For each time a user searches weather for a city, this city is saved as a button; when clicked, it will display the saved city's current weather and 5-Day Forecast.  An alert message is presented if the user typed a city that was not found.
